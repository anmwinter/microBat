<br>PROJECT OVERVIEW</br>
Recently microbiomes of humpback whales, dolphins, shrimp, and external body parts on humans have generated interest in external microbiota  and provide a new framework for microbial ecology, drug discovery, conservation management, and important links to macroecology. However, we have little to no understanding of the external bacteria microbiome on bats or factors that influence the structure of these communities. White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a newly emergent disease that results in moderate to very high mortality in affected bats. Our results provide a first insight into the distribution of external bat bacteria in a WNS-free environment. For this study we used 16S rRNA gene 454 pyrosequencing on 186 bats from 14 species sampled across southeastern New Mexico to northwestern Arizona. The microbial communities on bats in the region were highly variable with representatives from Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Nitrospira, and Cyanobacteria. The patterns could be partly explained by environmental and local factors, with cave-caught bats sharing more similar external microbial communities based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. Bats caught in caves had a distinct microbial community compared to those that were netted on the surface. Our results also suggest that bats caught in the cave have a more homogenized external microbiome.
