Microbiom of the Bat Environment Project

This is a collection of scripts, workflow, and data for the microbiom of the bat environment project based out of the University of New Mexico

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
White-nose syndrome (WNS), a disease caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans1, has spread west from New York
to Missouri and has killed more than six million bats2. In bat hibernacula where WNS is present, mass mortality has 
been observed and there is a high potential for population collapse or extinction of some species at a regional level.
Although WNS is not yet present in the western U.S. , the high diversity of bat species3 and appropriate conditions
for P. destructans in area caves may put these populations at risk. The absence of WNS in western caves provides a 
unique opportunity to ask questions about how bat species, geographic location, and habitat shape pre-WNS microbiota.
The importance of microbiota is shown in many organisms, including amphibians, where individuals that survive a 
chytrid infection carry a higher prevalence of Janthinobacterium lividum4. The establishment of a pre-WNS baseline
microbiota of western bats is critical to understanding how P. destructans may impact the native microbiota of the 
bats. Previous studies5,6 that identified the microbiota of bats have focused on gut and fecal microbiota, with 
little attention given to the external microbiota. Here we show for the first time that there are biogeographic 
differences in the abundance and diversity of external bat microbiota.
